define NUM_POINTS as 5

define a struct Point with fields:
  x: integer
  y: integer

define a function distance with input parameters:
  point1: Point
  point2: Point
and output:
  double

begin main function
  define array points as Point with length NUM_POINTS
  print "Enter the coordinates of the points:"
  for i from 0 to NUM_POINTS-1
    print "Point", i+1, ": "
    read points[i].x
    read points[i].y

  define crow_flies_distance as double
  set crow_flies_distance to distance of points[0] and points[NUM_POINTS-1]
  print "The optional distance between the start and end points is", crow_flies_distance

  define chain_length as double
  set chain_length to 0
  for i from 0 to NUM_POINTS-2
    set chain_length to chain_length + distance of points[i] and points[i+1]
  print "The distance by meandering is", chain_length

define distance function
  define output as double
  set output to square root of:
    (point1.x - point2.x)^2 + (point1.y - point2.y)^2
  return output
